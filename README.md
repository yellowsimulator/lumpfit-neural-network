------Implementation of lumped parameter modelling with a neural network------.

Lumped parameter modelling divides a geothermal reservoir up to
3 parts interconnected by lumped parameters. The parameters are determined 
by fitting the theoretical pressure response of the reservoir to measured pressure data.

This implementation of lumped parameter modelling uses a neural network to fit
the theoretical pressure response to the measured pressure data. By using a neural network
there is no need to guess the initial parameters...
